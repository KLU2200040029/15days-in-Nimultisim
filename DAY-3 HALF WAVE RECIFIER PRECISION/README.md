# Precision Half-Wave Rectifier

## Overview

This project implements a precision half-wave rectifier circuit using operational amplifiers. A precision half-wave rectifier is a circuit that rectifies only the positive half of an input signal while maintaining accuracy and linearity, often used in signal processing and instrumentation applications.

## Features

- Precision rectification of positive half-cycles of input signals
- Low distortion and offset errors
- Wide input voltage range
- High linearity and accuracy
- Simple and efficient circuit design
